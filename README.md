# Bubble sort

## Built With

- Ruby

## Getting Started

### Objectives
- Create a bubble sort.
- A bubble sort is a code where you compare two elements that are next to each other in an array, this comparison is made so we know if one element is bigger than the other, if that's the case, the compared elements will be changed with one another. We repeat this method as needed so the whole array is sorted.
